                      <p>travelling Essay – To travel from one place to another for different purposes is generally called travelling. People do not travel always for the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. It has much educative value. It is a part of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. We can learn many things from travelling. It teaches us to trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. . </p>

                      <p>Man is a traveler by nature. He does not like to keep static at a place for a long time. So, people like to visit new places whenever they find time and opportunity. People travel for different purposes. Some travel for getting an education and some travel for pleasure. Many people also travel for business and employment. Travelling is, indeed, very pleasant. It is useful too. By traveling to new places we can know new people and learn many new things. Travelling opens new vistas of experience and understanding for us </p>

                      <p>Traveling in the Past: In the past, traveling was not easy. People had to travel long distances on foot or horseback. They also traveled in ships and horse-cart. At some places, people used bullock carts, camels, and elephants. In snow-covered countries, people used the sled. Then traveling even a short distance was much bothering and time-consuming.When we go to a new place all of our senses and instincts (বােধশক্তি) become awake (জাগ্রত). In such circumstances, we can learn new things very easily. E

               <p>Travelling means going from one place to another in different purposes. They also explore to see the unseen and know the unknown. The travellers always travel the most beautiful places of the world which uphold the existence of nature. All things are created by Allah. There are many means to see the unseen and know the unknown, but travelling is the best of all. For example: Reading books gives us literal knowledge, listening story gives us indefinite ideas, but travelling gives us visual as well as concrete knowledge. At the same time, people do not travel in the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. There are different types of travelling like- travelling by air, bus, boat, train, bus etc. Every travelling has much educative value. It is a part of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling.Therefore, the educative value of travelling beggars description. Besides, there are some special benefits of travelling. If a man stays at one place for a long time, he becomes monotonous and his life becomes boring and callous. Travelling removes our monotony and gives pleasure. Similarly, it also broadens our outlook and refreshes our mind. A good traveler can easily educate others. He can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of other country. I like travelling very much.Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. </p>
